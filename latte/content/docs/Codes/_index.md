#  Code Simulations

This page collects simulations I've built to explore and explain technical concepts in machine learning, embedded systems, and algorithms. Each simulation links to its GitHub repository, where full code and documentation are maintained.

##  Featured Simulations


### Pi Estimation (Monte Carlo)
Utilize $f_x(.)$ and calculated expectation during iterative randomized sampling
- Topics: [Probabilistic ML](/Topics/signal/)
- [ðŸ“‚ GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yourusername/signal-sim)
- Tag: Educational 


### Signal Reconstruction (FFT vs DTFT)
Compare frequency-domain techniques using real audio snippets or test signals.
- Topics: [Signal Processing](/Topics/signal/)
- [ðŸ“‚ GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yourusername/signal-sim)
- Tag: Utility-Oriented
