# Welcome
This is my personal knowledge hub, where I explore and document topics across:
Each section links to real projects, simulations, and blog reflections — many of which are tied to my GitHub

---

# Blog
About my life, thoughts, and hobbies — from self-reflection to learning notes.
- [Visit my Blog Page]({{< ref "Blog.md" >}})

---
# Code Simulations
Explore simulation-focused projects that draw from domains such as game theory, signal processing, modern algorithms, and key areas in AI/ML — including computer vision, recommender systems, and probabilistic inference.
- [All Simulations]({{< ref "Codes.md" >}})

> You'll also find systems-level work spanning embedded development, real-time scheduling, and computer architecture.
