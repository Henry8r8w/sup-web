Decentralized Matching # Modern matching theory models decentralized trade using bipartite graphs.\nExample:\nMedical residency matching (n-to-1) they rank yours , you rank yours (linnk) Bipartite Graphs and Matching Theory # A bipartite graph is a graph where:\nNodes are divided into two disjoint sets: A and B.\nEdges connect nodes only across sets, never within.\nKey Concepts # Perfect Matching # A perfect matching is when every node in set A is matched to a unique node in set B and vice versa.\nMarriage Theorem (Hall\u0026rsquo;s Theorem) # A bipartite graph has a perfect matching iff for every subset $S‚äÜAS \\subseteq A$, the set of neighbors $N(S)‚äÜBN(S) \\subseteq B$ satisfies:\n$$|N(S)| \\geq |S| ]$$\nIf this condition is violated, the subset S is called a constricted set.\nConstricted Set # Definition:\nA subset S‚äÜAS \\subseteq A is constricted if the number of neighbors it connects to in BB is strictly less than ‚à£S‚à£|S|. That is, ‚à£N(S)‚à£\u0026lt;‚à£S‚à£|N(S)| \u0026lt; |S|.\nImplication: No matter how you match, at least one agent in SS will remain unmatched. This is a structural constraint‚Äînot a flaw of the algorithm.\nExample Graph (Non-Perfect Matching) # graph LR\rsubgraph A [ ]\ra1((a‚ÇÅ))\ra2((a‚ÇÇ))\ra3((a‚ÇÉ))\rend\rsubgraph B [ ]\rb1((b‚ÇÅ))\rb2((b‚ÇÇ))\rb3((b‚ÇÉ))\rend\ra1 --\u0026gt; b1\ra2 --\u0026gt; b1\ra2 --\u0026gt; b2\ra2 --\u0026gt; b3\ra3 --\u0026gt; b1 Now, consider the subset $S={a1,a3}S = {a_1, a_3}$\nNeighbors $N(S)={b1}N(S) = { b_1 }$\n$‚à£N(S)‚à£=1\u0026lt;2=‚à£S‚à£|N(S)| = 1 \u0026lt; 2 = |S|$\nExample Graph (Perfect Matching) # graph LR\rsubgraph A [ ]\ra1((a‚ÇÅ))\ra2((a‚ÇÇ))\ra3((a‚ÇÉ))\rend\rsubgraph B [ ]\rb1((b‚ÇÅ))\rb2((b‚ÇÇ))\rb3((b‚ÇÉ))\rend\ra1 --\u0026gt; b1\ra2 --\u0026gt; b1\ra2 --\u0026gt; b2\ra2 --\u0026gt; b3\ra3 --\u0026gt; b3 Centralized vs Decentralized # Centralized Decentralized Central auctioneer (Walrasian) Peer-to-peer interactions Strategy-proof mechanisms Strategic misreporting possible One-to-one or n-to-1 matching Risk of unmatched agents Strategy-Proof Matching # Goal of market design: prevent strategic manipulation (e.g., lying to get better outcome).\nAlgorithms like Deferred Acceptance (DA) are strategy-proof on one side.\nMatch Making Algorithm # The basic model # Setup # Agents\nsome number of seller: B_s where i in s some number of Buyers: N_b, where j in b Action space\nSeller puts house up for sale for $p_i ‚â• 0$ Buyer can buy at most one house Preferences\nSellers value house at 0 (this is a simplification w.l.o.g.) Buyers have some private valuation vij for each house Payoffs\nSellers want to maximize selling price p_i Buyers want to maximize vij ‚àí pi (their value - sale price for i hosue) Equilibrium Market-clearing prices set such that no player desires to deviate Sounds like Nash eqm, but not exactly the same concept To solve for equilibrium\nGiven a buyer j, define a set of preferred sellers as those that maximize payoff Preferred-Seller Graph # Given price vector s, construct preferred seller graph as follows There exists a link between buyer and seller if buying from that seller maximizes utility With discrete prices, each is not nessesary unique, so this will not (in geenral) lead to a one-to-one matching Notice that thre resulting graph is condition on p In general, we are intersted in making statements about mapping from p to graph Example # Agents\nthree sellers / houses: a, b, c Buyers\rSellers\ra\rb\rc\rx\r12\r4\r2\ry\r8\r7\r6\rz\r7\r5\r2\r- Three buyers with valuation as follows\r- value vecotr: - x: (a:12, b: 4, c : 2)\r- y: (a:8, b: 7, : c 6)\r- z: (a:7, b:5, c: 2)\r- Three sellers: abc with price vectors as follows (which we will be testing)\r- price vector: (5, 2, 0);(2,1,0); (3,1, 0)\rSellers action: max{p_i} Buyers action: { vij ‚àí pi} note:\nthis is a naive process, because equilibirum could exit with more than one kind of price vector Market CLearing Prices # If the resulting preferred-seller graph has perfect matching Theroem: For any set of buyer valuations, there exists a set of market-clearing prices But for only some set of selll prices, there exist a set of market-clearing valuation Efficiency # effiicney can be biased towards seller or buyer, whihc is something that we can control (simuilate)\ntrasnfer utility matching model $$ \\text{Welfare} = \\underbrace{\\sum_i p_i}{\\text{Seller utility}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_j (v{ij} - p_j)}_{\\text{Buyer utility}} $$ Efficent is max{Welfare}\nTheorem\nFor any set of market-clearing prices, a perfect matching in the resulting preferred-seller graph has the maximum total valuation of any assignment of buyers to sellers Finding Market-Clearnign Prices # Without a price vecotr given, how would we have market clearing rpices?\nTO make compairons\ntotal welfare consumer and seller surplus in the total welfare Algorithm At iteration 1, set all prices to 0 At each iteration, - 1 Re-scale all prices so that smallest one is 0 - 2 Construct preferred-seller network - 3 If there is a perfect matching (no constricted set), then we‚Äôre done - 4 If there is a constricted set of buyers, raise price of neighbors of buyers in that set each by 1 unit Pareto optimailty # This is a type of ascending price auction Start at lowest price that will get all sellers to participate In general, it will find a low price\nIn most cases, we can uniformly raise the price by some amount and still get the same transactions Decreasing price auction will in general find a higher price\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/codes/","title":"Code Simulations","section":"Docs","content":" Code Simulations # This page collects simulations I\u0026rsquo;ve built to explore and explain technical concepts in machine learning, embedded systems, and algorithms.
